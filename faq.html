                    <summary>Is trading risky?</summary>
                    <p>Yes, trading in financial markets (Forex, Stocks, etc.) involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. You could lose some or all of your invested capital. It is crucial to understand these risks fully before you start trading. We always recommend starting with a demo account.</p>

                    <summary>What is the minimum capital required to start trading?</summary>
                    <p>While some brokers allow very small deposits (e.g., $10 or ₹500), we generally recommend starting with a minimum of ₹5,000 to have a more meaningful trading experience and better risk management. Always invest only what you can afford to lose.</p>
