            <p>Welcome to the exciting and vast world of Forex (Foreign Exchange) trading! If you're new to financial markets, the Forex market can seem daunting, but at its core, it's quite simple: it's where currencies are exchanged.</p>

            <h2>What is Forex?</h2>
            <p>Forex, or FX, is the global marketplace for exchanging national currencies. It's the largest financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars exchanged daily. Unlike stock markets, there's no central exchange; trading occurs electronically over-the-counter (OTC) between banks, institutions, and individual traders worldwide.</p>
            <p>The primary purpose of the Forex market is to facilitate international trade and investment. However, a significant portion of trading is speculative, where traders aim to profit from currency price fluctuations.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Currency Pairs</h2>
            <p>In Forex, currencies are always traded in pairs. When you buy one currency, you simultaneously sell another. For example, EUR/USD is a common currency pair:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EUR:</strong> This is the <strong>base currency</strong>. It's the currency you are buying or selling.</li>
                <li><strong>USD:</strong> This is the <strong>quote currency</strong>. It's the currency used to express the value of the base currency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If EUR/USD is trading at 1.0850, it means 1 Euro is worth 1.0850 US Dollars. When you buy EUR/USD, you are buying Euros and simultaneously selling US Dollars. When you sell EUR/USD, you are selling Euros and buying US Dollars.</p>

            <h2>Pips (Percentage in Point) Explained</h2>
            <p>A pip is the smallest unit of price movement for a currency pair. For most currency pairs, a pip is the fourth decimal place (0.0001). For Japanese Yen (JPY) pairs, a pip is the second decimal place (0.01).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If EUR/USD moves from 1.0850 to 1.0851, that's a 1-pip movement.</li>
                <li>If USD/JPY moves from 145.20 to 145.21, that's a 1-pip movement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding pips is crucial because it's how traders measure profit or loss. Want to calculate the value of a pip for your trades? Check out our <a href="../tools.html">Pip Value Calculator</a>!</p>

            <h2>Leverage: Magnifying Your Trades (and Risks)</h2>
            <p>Forex trading often involves leverage, which allows you to control a large amount of currency with a relatively small amount of your own capital. For example, 1:100 leverage means for every $1 you put up, you can control $100 in the market.</p>
            <p>While leverage can significantly amplify your potential profits, it also magnifies your potential losses. It's a double-edged sword that must be used with extreme caution and proper risk management.</p>

            <h2>Who Trades Forex?</h2>
            <p>The Forex market participants include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Banks:</strong> The biggest players, executing trades for themselves and their clients.</li>
                <li><strong>Corporations:</strong> Conducting international business and needing to exchange currencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Central Banks:</strong> Intervening to stabilize their national currencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Hedge Funds & Investment Managers:</strong> Managing large portfolios.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Traders:</strong> People like you, trading for speculative profit.</li>
            </ul>
